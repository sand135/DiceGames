Two consolegames (Simple dicegame and Pig-game) made in Java for a schooltask.

Each turn, the player on turn guesses how many points he/she will roll (each eye on the dice is one point). Then he rolls all of his dices, and if the guess was correct,
the player icreases his scores with one point. The player with most scores after five rounds wins!
